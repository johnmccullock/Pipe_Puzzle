# Pipe_Puzzle

A simple puzzle game where the player takes plumbing pipe parts and connects them together so that they reach from one side of the game board to the other.

Not complete, yet, but has a lot of promise.

The most memorable part of this code, to me, is the use of the DisjointSet class to determine a complete path through all the parts.
