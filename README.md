# Pipe_Puzzle

A simple puzzle game where the player takes plumbing pipe parts and connects them together so that they reach from one side of the game board to the other.

Important note: you need to copy the "data", "images" and "resources" folders into the java-generated bin folder.  The bin folder is where Java will look for these items.

Not complete, yet, but has a lot of promise.

The most memorable part of this code, to me, is the use of the DisjointSet class to determine a complete path through all the parts.
